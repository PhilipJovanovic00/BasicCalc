# BasicCalc
This little program is my first attempt to do something with C++. The Calculator is console based, a GUI may come in the future, 
but for now its a bit too complicated to do something like that as a beginner. The V1.0 Calculator Can do 4 operations:
Addition, Subtraction, Multiply and Divide. The other Versions will support things like power of numbers, square root, percent and other. 
If you want to use this code to play around with it, you can do that. I recommend just copying the main.cpp File since the Project has been made with
CLion and some may not have this IDE.
